# Fake-News-Detection

## Done under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Arka Prokash Mazumdar of MNIT Jaipur

# Introduction 

In the recent years, fake news shared on social media have become a much recognized topic. Hence, methods for automatically identifying fake news is a topic which has gained some attention.The study initially explores the characteristics of fake news and the challenges of detecting it. Then, it presents an overview of ML algorithms and their application to fake news to perform fake news detection.

The identification of false information has become a critical concern in the modern era of technology, as the ready availability of information and widespread utilization of social media platforms have accelerated the dissemination of inaccurate news. The ability to accurately identify false news can help to mitigate the negative effects of misinformation, such as public confusion, political polarization, and potential harm to public health and safety. This project presents a comprehensive review of ML based approaches for fake news detection.By utilizing fake news detection models, We can filter out fake news and focus on accurate and reliable information.
The Project shows performance of several Machine Learning algorithms on a dataset of real and fake news articles.

# Software and Hardware Requirements

1. Programming language: Python
2. Environment: Jupyter Notebook
3. Machine learning libraries: sklearn
4. Data manipulation libraries: numpy
5. Data visualization libraries: matplotlib and seaborn 
6. Dataset: Uploaded 
7. Hardware accelerator: CPU (Jupyter Notebook)
8. Runtime type: Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)

# Project Roadmap

1. Importing the libraries
2. Setting the path to the dataset
3. Inserting a traget feature 'class'
4. Making a new dataset using the Fake and Real Datasets
5. Shuffling the datapoints in the new datasets
6. Preprocessing
7. Training the data on 4 different Machine Learning Algorithms
8. Forming Confusion Matrix for all to compare all models
9. Manually Entering the data to be checked in the model and predicting

# Project Status

The original goal of the project has been achieved but there are further improvements to be added and there can be further extension of this project like implementing the dataset on a Deep Learning model.
